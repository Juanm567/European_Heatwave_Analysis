# European_Heatwave_Analysis
Climate Event Analysis â€“ Fellowship Final Project
This project analyzes the 2003 European Heatwave using historical climate datasets. It includes data cleaning, anomaly calculations, seasonal averaging, and visualizations to assess the extremity of the heatwave in the context of long-term trends. Tools used include Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebooks. The goal is to showcase data science skills in environmental analysis and storytelling with climate data.
